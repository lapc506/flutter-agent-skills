# Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Scripts Dependencies

# Failover Procedures Manager
# No external dependencies (uses only stdlib: dataclasses, enum, json, subprocess, pathlib)

# Note: Scripts may require system tools:
# - kubectl (for Kubernetes operations)
# - aws CLI (for AWS operations)
# - curl (for health checks)
# - PostgreSQL tools (pg_dump, pg_basebackup) for database backups
